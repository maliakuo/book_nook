# Description
A “book nook” is a shadow box meant to fit into a bookshelf and depicts any scene from civilization to nature or fantasy. Our project is a series of three interactive book nooks combined to create an escape room experience. The user acts as the fated hero meant to restore light and beauty to a cursed land. In the first book nook, a portal, the user has to decode the riddle provided by a Processing program to open the door to the next book nook, a magical forest scene. Here, the user must interact with the box in order to restore life to the land. Once all touch sensors are triggered, the final box will light up and the hero has saved the land.
